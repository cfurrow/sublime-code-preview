Sublime Code Preview
====================

Preview the compiled code for CoffeeScript, IcedCoffeeScript, TypeScript (keep coming) in sublime text editor.
Get inspired by [Web Essentials](http://vswebessentials.com/), a Visual Studio extension.

## How it works

The plugin only works if you turn on multiple views. The compiled code is saved and loaded into the 2nd view.
Here is a screenshot for you to feel how it looks like.
